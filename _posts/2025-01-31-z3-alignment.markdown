# Home Alignment

It's a lot of guess and check, but fairly doable if you're up to the tediousness.



I never thought I'd be doing a home alignment and I never thought I could do it successfully on day one. Using the string box method, it was A LOT of guess-and-check, research, and math. If this is something up your alley, then hopefully I can make it less painful for you. It took me about 6 hours just to do front toe, a lot of it was recalibrating, validating, and correcting mistakes and assumptions. If not for the trial



## Before Alignment specs

To do an alignment, I used:

- 6" Ruler
- String
- Four tripods, any standing object will do
- Tools to adjust tie rod
- Tape measure
- Paint marker

Record your measurements the most convenient way you can. I used pen, paper, and my computer.

## Setup the string

To setup the string, they just need to be parallel to each other, as long as we setup the strings with the same distance from the car, accounting for the measurements from all tires and other car dimensions, we can assume they are relatively parallel.

1.  Setup on a relatively level surface

2. Straighten your steering wheel
   ![Alignment setup wheel](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/z3/maintenance/before-alignment-setup-4.jpg)

3. Setup up your strings at half height of each wheel

4. With a ruler, measure from the center of the wheel to the string. The measurement does not matter, but as long we get the same distance, it's all fine. Here, I'm using the 2" marker to align the strings; however, this is not 2" away since there is some run-up at the beginning of the ruler. The measurement doesn't matter, but if it helps, I setup my strings a bit more than 2" away from the centercaps.

5. Repeat the string on each wheel to setup the strings.

6. Starting with the Front LEFT wheel, use your caliper's depth gauge to measure from the string to the front of the wheel. Then repeat on the rear of the front LEFT wheel. You will get measurements A and B in this way. To get an accurate measurement, measure from the string to the wheel using the depth gauge. Repeat and measure for all four wheels.
   
   | Front Left Front (A)                                         | Front Left Rear (B                                           |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | A = 1.6055"                                                  | B = 1.158"                                                   |

   *BEWARE, if your calipers are metal, they will scratch your wheel. To prevent damage, add painter's tape and compensate for the thickness of the paint. These wheels with heavily curbed so I didn't care too much.*

## Pre-Alignment Results - It's bad

![Before alignment](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/z3/maintenance/before-alignment.png)

With these results, look at the toe degrees (orange highlight) and compare it to your vehicle's degree toe specifications. Looking at ours, lets compare:

| Specification             | Front (degrees) | Front (decimal degrees) | Rear (degrees) | Rear (decimal degrees) |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Toe angle (total degrees) | 0° 18' ± 8'     | **0.3° ± .13°**         | 0° 20' ± 13°   | 0.33° ± .2167°         |

| Location    | Before Alignment | Measurement   | Difference | Condition |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Front left  | 1.03°            | 0.15° ± .065° | 0.88°      | BAD       |
| Front right | -0.81°           | 0.15° ± .065° | -0.96°     | BAD       |
| Total       | 0.23°            | 0.3° ± .13°   | 0.07°      | GOOD*     |

Funny enough,  while the front toe is shooting straight to the right, because of their relative measurements, the total front toe is still in spec range! With these measurements, we can see that both front wheels need adjustments to get closer to the ideal 0.3°. Look at the difference column and that is how much we should try to adjust out to get 0.15°. Since there are two wheels, setting up at 0.15° for each wheel should get us close to the 0.3°.

My goal is 0.3° toe in at the front wheels, this gives us a goal of 0.15° toe for each front wheel.

## Adjusting front toe

With our differences calculated, let's adjust the tie rod length to adjust toe.

In my case, I lifted the car each time I wanted to adjust, rocked the car back and forth to get the suspension to settle, turned the steering wheel to center, recalibrated the strings to the 2" line, then took my measurement. In hindsight, I could have done other methods, but this was the most straightforward without having to use or build any extra parts.



1. Turn the steering wheel to expose the tie rod. In my case, I turned all the way right to adjust the FR wheel.

![Before alignment](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/z3/maintenance/tie-rod-adjustment-4.jpg)

2. With the tie rod exposed, grab your 22mm and 13mm wrench and loosen the locknut.

![Before alignment](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/z3/maintenance/tie-rod-adjustment-2.jpg)

![Before alignment](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/z3/maintenance/tie-rod-adjustment-1.jpg)3. Once the locknut is released, on the FIRST adjustment, turn the tie rod by 1/6 of a turn (equal one face of the hex surface) to shorten or lengthen the tie rod. This will get us a baseline of what 1/6 of a turn will do to our tie rod. Lower the car and record the change.

![Before alignment](https://www.sudoyashi.com/assets/img/z3/maintenance/tie-rod-adjustment-3.jpg)

In my case, changing the tie rod by 1/6 of a turn results in a 0.2" difference. To adjust our toe smarter we can do some more math:

- <u>FR Difference</u> from spec from spec E and spec F = 1.209"-1.560"
  - FR Difference = .351"
  - 1/6 of a turn = .2" difference
  - 1 turn = 0.2" * 6 = 1.2"
  - Turns to get .351 = 0.351/1.2 = **0.2925 turns**

With this assumption, we can try to turn 0.29 turns or a quarter-turn and then some, and see what happens! But wait, which way do you turn it?

### Which way to turn your tie rods

Tie rods are just another screw, as you "tighten" it, it gets shorter. If you "loosen" it, it gets longer. But the effects may vary depending on the location.

There are differences in how the tie rod will affect your alignment based on if it is in-front of or behind center. This is a table that can generally explain the effects on each side of the wheel.

| Location, front                      | If you shorten the tie rod (tighten), you get... | Lengthen tie rod (loosen), you get... |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Front left, tie rod front of center  | toe in, positive                                 | toe out, negative                     |
| Front right, tie rod front of center | toe in, positive                                 | toe out, negative                     |
| Rear left, tie rod front of center   | toe in, positive                                 | toe out, negative                     |
| Rear right, tie rod front of center  | toe in, positive                                 | toe out, negative                     |

| Location, behind                     | If you shorten the tie rod (tighten), you get... | Lengthen tie rod (loosen), you get... |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Front left, tie rod behind of center | toe out, negative                                | toe in, positive                      |
| Front right, tie rod behind center   | toe out, negative                                | toe in, positive                      |
| Rear left, tie rod behind center     | toe out, negative                                | toe in, positive                      |
| Rear right, tie rod behind center    | toe out, negative                                | toe in, positive                      |

### Turning the tie rod 0.2925 turns

In order to make up the FR Difference of .351", we will turn our tie rod by 0.2925 turns CCW.
