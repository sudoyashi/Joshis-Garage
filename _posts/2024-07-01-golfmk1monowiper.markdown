Golf Mk1 Monowiper conversion, without cutting

A monowiper was a side project I wanted to do because I didn't want to finish the engine swap. The original MK1 wiper motor also is pretty shit and when disassembling the original arm assembly, one of the nuts go so corroded I had to grind it out of place. With the potential to put in a mono wiper for the shits and giggles and looking absolutely ridiculous, I finally did it.

## What you'll need

- Scirocco mono wiper assembly

Tools
- 23mm socket
- 13mm socket
- 10mm socket
- Screwdriver

## Disassembly

1. Disconnect the battery terminal to prevent shorting
2. Disconnect motor and remove arm assembly
   1. Remove the nut securing the wiper motor to the rain tray bracket
   2. Open the hood and disconnect the wiper plug from the motor
   3. On the wipers, remove the plastic caps and remove the10mm nuts
   4. Remove the top washer
   5. Remove the wiper armm
   6. Remove the wiper body cap
   7. Remove the 23mm thin nut, this secures the arms to the body
   8. Remove the spring washer, it's wavy for a reason!
   9. Repeat on the other arm.
3. Once the fasteners are removed from the top, you SHOULD be able to
