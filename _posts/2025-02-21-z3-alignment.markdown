# Home Alignment

It's a lot of guess and check, but fairly doable if you're up to the tediousness.



I never thought I'd be doing a home alignment and I never thought I could do it successfully on day one. Using the string box method, it was A LOT of guess-and-check, research, and math. If this is something up your alley, then hopefully I can make it less painful for you. It took me about 6 hours just to do front toe, a lot of it was recalibrating, validating, and correcting mistakes and assumptions. If not for the trial



## Before Alignment specs

To do an alignment, I used:

- 6" Ruler
- String
- Four tripods, any standing object will do
- Tools to adjust tie rod
- Tape measure
- Paint marker

Record your measurements the most convenient way you can. I used pen, paper, and my computer.

## Setup the string

To setup the string, they just need to be parallel to EACH OTHER, not necessarily to the vehicle; but that doesn't mean it's imposible! Using the incredible calcualtor found on [https://robrobinette.com/](https://robrobinette.com/DIYAlignmentCalculator.htm), this calculator will compensate for the angle of the car when setting up the string. So, as long as we setup the strings with the same distance from the car, along with the measurements from all tires and other car dimensions, we can assume a relatively accurate alignment at home.

1.  Setup on a relatively level surface

2. Straighten your steering wheel

3. Setup up your strings at half height of each wheel

4. Setup your string at a distance that you can keep consistent. The measurement doesn't matter, but if it helps, I setup my strings a bit more than 2" away from the centercaps.

5. Repeat the string on each wheel to setup the strings.

6. Starting with the Front LEFT wheel, use your caliper's depth gauge to measure from the string to the front of the wheel. Then repeat on the rear of the front LEFT wheel. You will get measurements A and B in this way. To get an accurate measurement, measure from the string to the wheel using the depth gauge. Be patient and gentle, this is why most people wouldn't do an alignment at home! 
   | Front Left Front (A)                                         | Front Left Rear (B)                                          |

   *BEWARE, if your calipers are metal, they will scratch your wheel. To prevent damage, add painter's tape and compensate for the thickness of the paint. These wheels with heavily curbed so I didn't care too much.*

   Repeat and measure for all four wheels.

## Before Alignment results

With these results, look at the toe degrees (orange highlght). Compare it to your vehicle's degree toe specifications. If you need to convert the degrees to inches, use a calculator to convert here: https://robrobinette.com/ConvertToeDegreesToInches.htm

In my case with the Z3, I referenced the following information from the Bentley manual for the base suspension:

| Specification             | Front (degrees) | Front (decimal degrees) | Rear (degrees) | Rear (decimal degrees) |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Toe angle (total degrees) | 0° 18' ± 8'     | **0.3° ± .13**          | 0° 20' ± 13°   | 0.33° ± .2167°         |

Your measurements will still be in INCHES, but when all is calculate into the website, your toe will be in DEGREES.

My goal is 0.3° toe in at the front wheels, this gives us a goal of 0.15° toe for our front wheels.
